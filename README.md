# Open Identity Symbols (OIS)

> Your identity as three symbols — derived from a key only your device holds.

**[Try it live →](https://PRYSYM.github.io/open-identity-symbols/app/)**

OIS is an open-source identity system that generates a globally unique, human-readable ID — three Unicode symbols — secured by a passkey on your device. No accounts. No servers. Works offline.

```
◯ ‑ △ ‑ ⬟   →   circle-triangle-pentagon
```

Your symbol ID is derived deterministically from the public half of a passkey created by your device's hardware. The same device always produces the same identity. No central authority assigns or controls it.

---

## How It Works

1. **Open the app** — runs entirely in your browser, no install needed
2. **Create a passkey** — your device (phone, laptop, security key) generates a P-256 key pair; the private key never leaves the hardware
3. **Derive your identity** — `SHA-256(SPKI public key bytes)` is sliced into three indices that map into a 5,000-symbol Unicode pool
4. **Get your ID** — e.g. `⚙-🌊-🔥 · gear-wave-fire` — permanent, globally unique, offline-ready

Optionally publish your identity to a discovery server so others can look you up by symbol or alias.

## Try the PWA

The PWA is hosted on GitHub Pages — no setup needed:

**[https://PRYSYM.github.io/open-identity-symbols/app/](https://PRYSYM.github.io/open-identity-symbols/app/)**

It works on any modern browser with WebAuthn support (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge). On mobile, your fingerprint or face ID secures the passkey.

---

## Run the PWA Locally

The PWA is static HTML/JS — no build tool, no bundler. You need a local HTTP server because WebAuthn and ES module imports don't work over `file://`.

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+ (for data generation)

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/PRYSYM/open-identity-symbols
cd open-identity-symbols

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Generate the data files (pool.js + alias.js)
python pwa/scripts/export_data.py

# 4. Serve the PWA directory over HTTP
python -m http.server 8080 --directory pwa
```

Then open **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)** in your browser.

> **Note:** WebAuthn requires either `localhost` or HTTPS. The `python -m http.server` approach works fine for local development on `localhost`.

## Hosted Discovery Server (PRYSYM)

PRYSYM runs a public discovery server on Cloudflare Workers + D1 (free tier):

**`https://ois-discovery.kathirpsmy.workers.dev`**

The PWA connects to it by default. You can also point the PWA at any self-hosted instance via **Server Config** in the UI.

---

## Self-Host the Discovery Server

The discovery server is optional. It lets users publish their symbol ID so others can look them up. Anyone can run their own instance.

**Option 1 — Cloudflare Worker (zero cost):** see [worker/README.md](worker/README.md).

**Option 2 — Docker Compose (self-hosted):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PRYSYM/open-identity-symbols
cd open-identity-symbols
docker compose up
```

The discovery API will be available at `http://localhost:8001`.

See [docs/discovery-server.md](docs/discovery-server.md) for full setup and API reference.

## Symbol Pool

- **5,390 curated Unicode symbols** — geometric shapes, arrows, math operators, nature emoji, and more
- Excludes religious, political, national-flag, and gendered symbols
- Capacity: **5390³ ≈ 156 billion unique identities** — enough for every person on Earth many times over
- Alias vocabulary: 5,500+ unique English words (real words + systematic color-nature compounds)

See [specs/unicode-pool.md](specs/unicode-pool.md) for curation rules and [specs/id-generation.md](specs/id-generation.md) for the derivation algorithm.

## Vision

OIS is designed to grow into a **standardized, open identity protocol**:

- Any app or service can verify an OIS identity without calling home to a central server
- Multiple discovery servers can federate — no single authority controls the namespace
- The derivation algorithm is deterministic and publicly specified — third parties can implement it independently
- Long-term goal: propose OIS as an open standard (similar in spirit to how email addresses work, but for symbolic, hardware-backed identities)

This is early-stage. The PWA and discovery server are working implementations. The protocol specification and federation layer are the next frontier — contributions welcome.
